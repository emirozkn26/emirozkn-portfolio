Kaplan Emir Özkan – Front-End Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my journey and skills as a front-end developer. I created this portfolio to practice building clean, modern, and responsive web interfaces, and to demonstrate the projects I've been working on while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

About Me

Hi, my name is Kaplan Emir Özkan. I’m currently working full-time at SarSistem
 in Ankara, Çankaya. I have strong skills in HTML and CSS, a solid understanding of the DOM, and basic knowledge of JavaScript. I enjoy creating simple and elegant user interfaces and constantly improving my coding skills. Currently, I am focused on building interactive projects and learning React step by step.

This portfolio reflects my current learning progress, showcasing both my practical projects and skill sets in a clean, organized, and modern layout.

Skills & Technologies

Here are the main technologies I work with:

HTML5 – Structuring clean and semantic web content

CSS3 – Styling modern and responsive interfaces

Flexbox & Grid – Creating flexible and adaptive layouts

JavaScript – Adding interactivity and manipulating the DOM

DOM Manipulation – Dynamically updating content for better UX

Responsive Design – Ensuring the website looks great on mobile and desktop

React (On Progress) – Learning component-based development

I also included progress bars to visually show my current proficiency in each technology.

Projects

Currently, the portfolio includes a few key projects:

Simple Todo List
 – A basic todo app that demonstrates DOM manipulation and user interaction using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

Portfolio Website – This very website! Built to showcase my skills, projects, and experience. Designed with a focus on clarity, simplicity, and responsiveness.

More projects coming soon! I plan to add interactive applications and experiments that demonstrate real-world front-end development skills.
