Kaplan Emir Özkan – Front-End Portfolio 🌐✨

Hey there! 👋 Welcome to my personal portfolio website. This project is a small window into my journey as a front-end developer. I built it to practice clean, modern, and responsive web design, while showing off some of the projects I’ve been working on while learning HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React.

About Me 💻

Hi, I’m Kaplan Emir Özkan. Currently, I work full-time at SarSistem
 in Ankara, Çankaya.

I’m comfortable with HTML and CSS, know the basics of JavaScript, and I like playing with the DOM to make web pages interactive. I enjoy crafting simple, clean, and user-friendly interfaces.

Right now, my main goal is to build interactive projects and gradually get better at React, one step at a time.

Skills & Technologies 🛠️

Here’s what I can do (or at least, what I’m working on! 😉):

HTML5 – Semantic, clean, and well-structured code

CSS3 – Modern styles with animations and responsive layouts

Flexbox & Grid – Flexible and adaptive layouts that work everywhere

JavaScript – Adding interactivity and manipulating the DOM

DOM Manipulation – Making pages dynamic and engaging

Responsive Design – Desktop? Tablet? Mobile? No problem!

React (On Progress) – Slowly but surely learning component-based web dev

I also included progress bars in the site so you can see where I’m at with each skill.

Projects 📂

Some highlights from my journey so far:

Simple Todo List
 – A basic todo app demonstrating DOM manipulation and user interaction.

Portfolio Website – Yup, this one! Built to showcase my projects, skills, and learning progress. Clean, modern, and fully responsive.

More projects are coming soon! Stay tuned for interactive experiments and fun coding challenges I plan to add. 🚀

What’s Next? 🔮

I plan to keep learning React, build more interactive projects, and polish my front-end skills. The goal is to make a portfolio that reflects both my skills and my personal style—simple, modern, and user-friendly.
